* **Settings should be 90% customizable** 
    * *example user can change font, background, enable or not features like shortcuts, code completion, text highlight* 

## |Â **Ideas**

* **If performance is our goal, we need to think better that why icame with somes of these ideas**

    * Since we are not supporting / including an IDE in our plan, we could make shortcuts to open a terminal in thesame directory for example like Ctrl + t

    * I also though of **lined based command example** in the app i write
    
    ```python
    1  from sys import stdout
    2
    3  def display(text: str | None) -> None:
    4      stdout.writeline(text)
    5
    6  display("hello")
    7  kepton -t > open (Alt+P)
     ```
        - In the line 7 we can use shortcut Alt + p to pop up a terminal in the same directory of the project

        - After the process get it input, it will check the input then it will delete and process the command purpose just to help in efficiency

        - Instead of kepton -t it can be kl -t (Alt+P) ( kl=kepton lite, -t=cmd)
